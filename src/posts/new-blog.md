Yeah, you're right, it's me. But hey- at least I said that I probably would when I finished my last rewrite.

Anyway, why don't we get onto the tech specs because we all ready know I'm inconsistent as hell and this was inevitable! :D

- The new blog is written is [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
- It hosts local markdown files imported with `import.meta.glob` in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and processed with [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.com/) instead of the database nonsense we were using last time!
  - Since it's native markdown, I can do fancy things like:

> Block quotes ✨

```
multi-
line
code
blocks
```

*(in addition to single line code!)*

and probably a whole bunch of other funky md syntax that I can't be bothered to learn!

~~Either way,  since it is a lot easier to write new posts, my blog hopefully won't be as dead!~~

edit 23-1-23: dunno what i expected, its still dead cause i never write anything :kek:
