Another changelog? woah dude thats crazy

The last changelog was actually somewhat verbose, but that won't be this one :)

I added loading bars (similar to the ones that are on this site as well now!) using [NProgress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress)! thats it!

I also just wanted to complain about how bad I am at using git- I wrote a custom deploy script that I forgot how to use which then kinda messed up my commit history but yk we vibe

But otherwise, actually talking about the project again, hopefully I can start working on groups and what not and we can get closer to v1!
