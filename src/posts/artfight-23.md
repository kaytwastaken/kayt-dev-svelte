*as july draws nearer, artists around the world prepare themselves <small>(and their wrists)</small> for the drawing competition to end them all...*

Now that it's July, I figure I should mention that I'm participating in Artfight this year! I first participated in 2020, and since then it's always been something I really look forward to. Last year I was only able to finish one drawing, and I completely forgot in 2021, but this year I'll hopefully be able to do more :D

<small>wait why on earth and i writing with proper grammar to hell with that</small>

i already have a list of characters i'd like to draw, and i've got another character to add to my [roster](https://artfight.net/~Kayt_was_taken/characters)!<br>
currently ive got three characters, one of which you can see on my [portfolio](/portfolio) page! you can also see last year's attack there.

for those also participating, i'm on team vampire! so if you wanna be on the same team as me, or you want to want to be my downfall, there you go!

anyway, i look forward to seeing what i can make this year and what get's made of my characters! make sure to follow me on [artfol](https://artfol.me/kayt_was_taken) as that's where i'll be sharing the finished pieces! and of course you can also check out my [artfight](https://artfight.net/~Kayt_was_taken) profile!
