title: Me? A new blog? Again?

excerpt: More likely than you'd think

So I know I have a reputation of rewriting my blog over and over again, but this time I have a reason! well- kind of a reason-

A while ago I saw an article called [Tired of the Modern Web? Try the ‘Gemini’ protocol](https://blog.devgenius.io/tired-of-the-modern-web-try-the-gemini-protocol-ba847f102fe6) so naturally, after having the tab open for ages (as I also have the reputation of a chronic tab-hoarder) I decided I'd mess around with Gemini one night. Aaaand give or take a couple hours later I have a mirror of my blog running off of [Agate](https://github.com/mbrubeck/agate) and serving pages on [gemini://kayt.dev](gemini://kayt.dev)! Of course you'll need a Gemini-specific browser to load it (I use [Lagrange](https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange)) but it's still really cool!

It's also ludicrously easy to add new blog posts to the Gemini site, so I imagine some of my more spur-of-the-moment ideas may get published there before I refine them and move them over here. The majority of content and webapps will still be hosted here, though!
