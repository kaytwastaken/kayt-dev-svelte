## Ignorant white girl has thoughts


So recently I've stumbled across the world of solarpunk, anarchism, and how fucking shit capitalism is. I'm surprised it took so long for a transit-obsessed queer girl at an art school, but I'm here now - am boy am I glad I'm here.

For reference, I have very little knowledge on any of this, I've come from a well-off family, and my world-view has been alternating between ignorant bliss, apathy, and complete climate despair - but I was having thoughts and I wanted to write them down somewhere.

So, big surprise, capitalism is shit. And I know that's rich coming from someone who's only lived its benefits and none of its downsides, but self-awareness is a virtue and even if I'm still incredibly ignorant and am absolutely not doing enough to learn more, I'm glad I know this much.

Solarpunk is the kind of movement I needed. I already mentioned that a lot of my worldview revolves around apathy and climate despair, but just the knowledge that there *is* something we can do, and it's beautiful, is the kind of thing I needed. Accepting the end times does nothing to make it better. Accepting the reign of capitalism will only get us closer to the fucked up world of "that cd projekt red game i won't name". Understanding that shit is fucked right now, but still having hope and still working to make things better, actually helps.

Ok but what the fuck is solarpunk? Please watch [this](https://youtu.be/hHI61GHNGJM) <small>( Youtube/Andrewism/"What is Solarpunk?" )</small>, I couldn't hope to explain it as well.

For a long time I had the kind of satanic-panic kind of view towards anarchism - the 'oh you want ranpant chaos and crime' reaction, but in a wonderful testament to the power of *actually talking to people*, I believe in it now. It doesn't mean chaos and crime, it means community and people. It doesn't mean riots and violence, it means worker-owned enterprises and cooperation. At least ideally.

Something like solarpunk can't thrive without the death of capitalism. The endless desire for profits and bigger margins is the complete opposite of sustainability. It only takes one look at anything related to the bezos company to see all the shit capitalism does to its workers. It only takes one look at the muskrat to see that wealth isn't responsible.

Well then how the fuck do you dismantle the system the entire world runs on? I don't know.

I mean of course anarchism is an ideal, but replacing one ism with another isn't a roadmap, it's a goal. But that's where solarpunk comes in. Having a goal isn't a bad thing - not at all - but a goal doesn't show you the steps to achieve it. But a movement like solarpunk has the power to give people the hope and inspiration to make change in their lives, now. Things like tactical urbanism ( [Wikipedia/Tactical Urbanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_urbanism), [Tactical Urbanism Guide/About](http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/about/) ), growing your own food, and participating in maker spaces can foster communities and drive change in them.

but i dont know, a lot of this might sound priveledged and ignorant, which it is, but i had a sudden burst of motivation to say *something* even if it's wrong, so i could have something to add to, so i could maybe tell someone something new, so i could have a chance to learn more. but i've said my piece, and i want to hear more, so i encourage anyone reading this to say what they think, talk about their ideas, and listen to what other people have to say. i'm also gonna go watch more [andrewism](https://www.youtube.com/c/Andrewism) <small>(Youtube/Andrewism)</small> and [our changing climate](https://www.youtube.com/c/OurChangingClimate) <small>(Youtube/Our Changing Climate)</small> videos because that's how i ended up here.

anyway, drink water, ride public transit, and i hope you have a good day!

p.s., watch these! i enjoyed them and highly recommend
