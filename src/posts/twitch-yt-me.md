Turns out I'm still alive, so what have I been doing in the time since I last wrote here?

## returning* to [twitch](https://twitch.tv/kayt_was_taken/about)!

Last week (feb 5th) I streamed on twitch for the first time in a few months! I've done a few one-off streams since my last streak, but none of them were particularly interesting. This time however, I want to try to keep a longer streak going! Of course, being a student I'm not sure how consistent I'll really be able to be, but I say it's always worth a shot.

### becoming a VTuber!

One of the more notable changes this time around is that I'm a vtuber now! Completely original I know, but it's fun so I don't care. I'm using [VSeeFace](vseeface.icu/) and a custom VRoid model - well, as custom as a VRoid can really be. Having said that I've [customised](https://youtube.com/shorts/QRks403ftr8?feature=share) it a little, and I'm taking the opportunity to learn some character modeling in Blender!

### streams!

But what I have actually been doing? Minecraft, mostly. Again not the most original, but I'm not that interested in chasing views and playing the newest games (though I think I will definitely play the Dead Space remake at some point!).

#### Minecraft
In Minecraft I'm playing with one of my older groups again, and I've got some ideas for a new story! As I plan more of that out, I feel like my Minecraft streams may become more behind-the-scenes. On another note, I've gotten one of my friends into streaming! He streams at [twitch.tv/cubicalcream](https://twitch.tv/cubicalcream) and has been playing a lot of modded Minecraft (specifically Nomifactory if you're interested)!

#### other games
As I already mentioned, I don't care much for chasing whatever games have been released recently and as such I focus my energy more on whatever I want to play at the time. So in the future I imagine there'll be more osu! and potentially things like Terraria or Factorio. I've also been thinking about doing chess with Cube. Though all of that requires time I'm not sure I have right now - especially chess considering I need to relearn how to be good.


### the beloved numbers
Partially so I can see how and if these change in the future, and just because I think it's interesting, I thought I'd include some of the numbers behind my streams here!
As of writing:

- I typically average a whopping *3 viewers*, who are most often some of my friends,
- and I have and equally outstanding *57 followers*, most of which have never returned for multiple streams.

Despite my less than impressive numbers, I still have a ton of fun, and I'm actually quite close to passing the requirements for Twitch affiliate! Will I do anything when I pass that milestone? Who knows! Either way, I'm excited to see where this hobby ends up taking me.

### the state of twitch

Taking a break from talking about myself, I though I'd take a second to just talk about Twitch as a whole. I knew it was already a depressing website in a handful of ways, but the number of times I've seen popular streamers playing the anti-semetic transphobic wizard game is genuinely disappointing :/ Call me a pessimist but it feels like media literacy is certifiably 6 feet under.

## happenings on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@kayt_was_taken)
Moving on to the other nightmare video site, I've been having a ton of fun making content for YouTube! I picked up editing again when I started throwing together some osu! highlights ([one of which](https://youtu.be/QLu8hOD2m1U) did surprisingly well, nearly reaching 1000 views!), and I've planned out a few larger projects! The biggest of which is still very much in the works (even though I had hoped to have it out in early January...). Right now the hardest part is getting the drawings I need for it done. ðŸ™ƒ

<blockquote><p lang="en">oh yea i do make art sometimes<br>peek of some of what i work on for video in future :) <br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FowQBweaYAIpm4s?format=jpg&name=medium"/><br>&mdash; <a href="https://t.co/8uCVEAdxta">see the original post on twitter</a></p></blockquote>

Other than that, I might start more uploading highlights from my streams, given I have the time to edit them.

## me!
Enough about all that though, how's the me? I'm not gonna tell you, cause that's weird. What I will say though is that gender is a scam and I go by [it/ze/hir/she/they](https://en.pronouns.page/@kayt_was_taken) now! :D

neopronouns are pretty swag ngl

anyway, drink water, ride public transit, and take time for your hobbies<br>
i'll see you around somewhere sometime maybe
