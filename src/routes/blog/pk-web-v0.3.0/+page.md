As you'll see on my [projects](/projects) page, I've been working on rewriting [pk-web](https://pk.kayt.dev) in svelte. I started the rewrite sometime in March of this year, and have been putting a lot more work into it recently! The code is still a mess ~~as is typical for my projects~~ but I've gotten it to version 0.3.0! (technically 0.3.2 as of writing this but uhzdfg symantics)

Now, v0.3 doesn't initally seem impressive, but as of it's release, I have implemented everything I planned to with the original Next.js version! Right now you can:
- View all member/system information (descriptions, proxies, privacy, etc)
- Edit all of the above
- Add/delete members,
- and View public information! (anything not hidden by the privacy settings of the system in question)

This isn't anywhere close to being fully-featured, but it's still much farther than I got working in next! Right now the features I'm planning for v1.0.0 are all centered around groups. (and of course adding a favicon other than svelte's default development one *shrug*)

After v1 I plan to add switch handling (viewing, editing, the usual) and a handful of QoL additions (tooltips on hover, description templates, color pickers, the fun stuff).

For now though, I really need to stop prioritizing it over my homework and actually work on my finals ._.

Until then, consider checking out PluralKit's [website](https://pluralkit.me) and Draconizations' [pk editor](https://pk-webs-beta.spectralitree.com/) as well!
